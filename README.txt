Here is a beamer template for HAP. Some brief instructions:

- copy "beamerthemehap.sty" and "bgroundhap.png" to the same directory where
  the beamer latex is.

- if possible, try to avoid user customization in the beamer latex file, as
  it can mess up with the style files. Please look at the "example.tex"
  file.

best,
